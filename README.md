How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

By creating modules besides each other and calling on them we can make the code more modular and versatile when we put common methods in them so we can import sections and call upon them in other modules. This is all to help reduce redundancy, which saves time and reduces the chance of creating errors when recreating the methods. It was adaptable by leaving the functions flexible enough to be able to be used with many different formats without major refactoring.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist I try to approach problem solving with a methodology that is structured and features distinct phases. The phases of analysis and planning where we figure out what the project needs and how to proceed. Implementing, testing, and iteration where we put the plan to paper and work out the kinks to make it work with testing it and improving it. The techniques I would favor in the future are agile methods from previous classes and client interview to fine tune expectations and parameters.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists help design, develop, and optimize software, systems, and algorithms to help solve real-world problems. It matters because technology is driving almost all aspects of life, and it needs people to make and maintain it and push it forward with as the world develops. This type of work matters to companies like Grazioso Salvare because it helps make the systems that make the companies more efficient or even enables them to be a company in the first place.
